abstract = {Human fertility is directly relevant to public health and more generally to human welfare in many ways. Fertility trends since 1950 are reviewed. In industrialized countries, fertility declined between 1950 and 2005 from about three births per woman to below the two-birth level that is required to maintain a stable population size. Concerns have arisen about population decline and a low ratio of workers to retired people. Over the same time span, fertility in Asia and Latin America dropped from 6 to 0.5 births, but in sub-Saharan Africa it remains high at 2.5 births. Continued rapid population growth in Africa will make socioeconomic progress more difficult.}
