# Declining Birth rates in the US: An Analysis of Potential Factors

This repo contains the code and data to produce 1) a paper which is a reproduction of [Kearney, Levine and Pardue (2022) 's paper, "The Puzzle of Falling US Birth Rates since the Great Recession"](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/jep.36.1.151) and 2) replications of the figures 1, 2a, 2b, 2d, 2e and 5 of this paper. 

It is organised as follows:

inputs
- data - contains all the data files to be used for analysis and in the tables and figures.
  - agecomp-seer.dta - data for figure 5 
  - fig_1.csv - data for figure 1
  - figs_1_2_3.csv - data for figures 1, 2a, 2b, 2d, 2e
  - figs_2a_2b.csv - data for figures 2a and 2b
  - nchs_cohort_analysis.dta. - data for figure 5
- literature
  - jep.36.1.151.pdf - the original paper of which we make a reproduction.

outputs

## Reproducibility

Download all files and open the R project us-birth-rates.Rproj in R Studio.

To reproduce the paper, knit to pdf paper.Rmd found at outputs/paper/paper.Rmd.

To replicate a figure, run the corresponding R file stored in replication/scripts/fig{number}\_replication.R. The output will be saved as an image in replication/plots/figure{number}.png .

The replication on the Social Science Reproduction Platform can be found at https://doi.org/10.48152/ssrp-srs6-t802 .
